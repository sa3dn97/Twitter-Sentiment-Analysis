# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This project will develop a tool for analyzing sentiment on Twitter. The tool will be able to identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in tweets. It will also be able to track sentiment over time and identify trends.

## Goals

The goals of this project are to:

* Develop a tool for analyzing sentiment on Twitter
* Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in tweets
* Track sentiment over time and identify trends


## Risks

The following risks have been identified for the project:

* The dataset of tweets may not be large enough to train a reliable model.
* The machine learning algorithm may not be able to accurately identify sentiment.
* The cloud computing platform may not be able to handle the volume of data.

## Mitigation strategies

The following mitigation strategies will be used to address the risks:

* The dataset of tweets will be augmented with data from other sources.
* The machine learning algorithm will be trained on a variety of data sets.
* The cloud computing platform will be scaled up as needed.

## Conclusion

This project has the potential to be a valuable tool for understanding public opinion. The tool will be able to track sentiment over time and identify trends. This information can be used to make better decisions about marketing, product development, and public policy.
